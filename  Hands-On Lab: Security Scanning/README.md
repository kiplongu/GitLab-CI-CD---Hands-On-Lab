# GitLab CI/CD - Hands-On Lab: Security Scanning
This Hands-On Guide walks you through the lab exercises in the GitLab CI/CD course.
Estimate time to complete: 15 - 20 minutes

We are transitioning to the latest version of this course. If your group URL starts with https://spt.gitlabtraining.cloud, please use the Version 15.x instructions.

Objectives
SAST, an optional feature on CI/CD pipelines, analyzes your source code for known vulnerabilities. GitLabâ€™s Vulnerability Report then shows any old or new vulnerabilities found with each pipeline run. In this lab, you will learn the process of enabling SAST scans in your CI/CD pipelines. You can learn more about SAST scanner by clicking here.


# Task A. Creating a Test File
Open your CICD Demo project from previous labs.

Near the top left, to the right of the branch dropdown, click (+) > This directory > New file.

Type run.py as the name of the file.

Copy and paste the following code into the body:

import subprocess

ip = input("Enter your server ip: ")
subprocess.run(["ping", ip])

print("Attempting to connect to the server")
print("Application authentication was successful")
Type Create Run.py as a test file into the commit message.

Set the Target branch to main.

Click Commit changes.

Note: This file has a command injection vulnerability, which can lead to security breaches. We are going to use the SAST Scanner to detect issues in our code.
